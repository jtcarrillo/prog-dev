# Why C++?


C++ of today provides programmers the ability to write expressive and robust code while still having the ability to target almost any hardware platform or real-time requirement. In short, C++ is a highly portable language which offers zero-cost abstractions. Furthermore, C++ provides programmers with the ability to write and manage large, expressive, and robust code bases. 

## Zero-cost abstractions

Active code bases grow. The more developers working on a code base, the larger the code base becomes. We need abstractions such as functions, classes, data structures, layers, and so on in order to manage the complexity of a large-scale code base. But constantly adding abstractions and new levels of indirection comes at a price - efficiency. This is where zero-cost abstractions plays its role. A lot of the abstraction offered by C++ comes at a very low price. At a minimum, C++ offers efficienct alternatives at hot spots where performance really is a concern. 

## Programming languages and machine code abstractions

In order to relieve programmers from dealing with computer-related terms, modern programming languages use abstractions so that a list of strings, for example, can be handled and thought of as a list of strings rather than a list of addresses that we may easily lose track of if we make the slightest typo. Not only do the abstractions relieve the programmers from bugs, they also make the code more expressive by using concepts from the domain of the application. In other words, the code is expressed in terms that are closer to a spoken language than if expressed with abstract programming keywords.
