# End To End Machine Learning Example

## Summary

In this project, we'll use the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. This dataset is based on data from the 1990 California census. This task is to use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Buereau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). 

The model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing prices in any district, given all the other metrics. 

## Main Steps

1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture.
    * Define the objective in business terms. 
    * How will your solution be used?
    * What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
    * How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
    * How should performance be measured?
    * Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective? 
    * What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
    * What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
    * Is human expertise available?
    * How would you solve the problem manually?
    * List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.
    * Verify assumptions if possible. 
2. Get the data
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model
7. Present your solution
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
